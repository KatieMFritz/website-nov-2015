      h2.featurette-heading I'm a geek.
      p Geek isn’t a bad word – it means I love to learn. These days, I mostly learn about project management, information architecture, user experience design, content strategy, taxes, and crochet (gotta have hobbies!). Earlier in my career, I’ve geeked nonprofit tech strategy, IT systems, association management, asset building policy, housing policy, and music. I still enjoy learning (and teaching) about all of those things.

      h2.featurette-heading I like people.
      p All of my projects put people at the center. Who visits your website? Why? How do they feel? What real, live humans have to maintain the site, and how can we make it easier? We’ll talk, a lot, and I’ll interview and observe as many people as I can to help make your website better.

      h2.featurette-heading I want to make an actual difference.
      p Like my clients, I want to make the world better, however I can. I’ve spent my whole career working in, volunteering for, and providing services to the nonprofit sector.  Not every nonprofit makes the world better, and most websites don’t really help. These days, that’s my focus. I get what it’s like to have a small tech budget, limited time, but a big mission! Together we can build your capacity so you can do more good.
